### Structure

* The website will be a single scrolling page with 3 page areas.
* The navigation bar will be sticky. This will become collapsable when on mobile device.
* The website will be responsive and the layouts will change according to the screen size.
* The first page area will be named Discover Syndey. This will outline what Sydney has to offer for tourists.
* The second page area will be named Explore. This will show the best attractions, bars/clubs, hotels and restaurants. 
* The third page area will be named Contact. This will have a contact form where tourists can give us feedback and suggestions.
* The footer will contain social media icons.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
**White** - Page headers, navigation bar and footer, this is because it will contrast well with the background images. 
<br>
**Black** - Navigation bar, section text and footer text, this is because it contrasts well with white.
<br>
#### Typography
**Oswald** - This font will be used throughout the whole webpage, this is because it looks clean, professional and is easy to read.
<br>
